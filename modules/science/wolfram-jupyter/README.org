* What is it
=wolfram-jupyter= is a NixOS module that helps you to setup the Jupyter kernel for Wolfram Language which is supported by Wolfram Engine.\\
With Wolfram Language support, one can easily manipulate and use thousands of builtin functions to perform scientific calculations.
* How to setup
** Step 1
Use =iceberg='s =science= overlay.\\
Add =pkgs.wolfram-engine= to your package list to install it.
** Step 2
Start =wolframscript= from terminal, and key in your Wolfram ID account and password to get a license.\\
Once activated, get the content of your mathpass:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cat ~/.WolframEngine/Licensing/mathpass
#+END_SRC
Copy the output.
** Step 3
Put =iceberg.nixosModules.wolfram-jupyter= into your flake module list.\\
#+BEGIN_SRC nix
{
  services.jupyter = {
    enable = true;
    password = "Your password here. See NixOS configuration manual for detail";
  };
  iceberg.wolfram-jupyter = {
    enable = true;
    mathpass = "Your mathpass";
  };
}
#+END_SRC
After rebuilding, it should be up and running at [[http://127.0.0.1:8888][localhost]].
